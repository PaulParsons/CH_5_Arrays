public class Deck {

	/*
	 * Create a class named exercises.Deck that contains the following:
	 * - An integer value named deckPosition signifying the current "top" of the deck.
	 * - A String array that holds all of the cards in the deck.
	 *
	 * - A method named buildDeck() that fills a String array with all 52 cards.
	 * --NOTE: You should NOT be typing out all 52 card's. Use arrays and for-each loops.
	 * -- Cards should be in the format of:
	 * -- [value] of [suit]
	 * Ex. Jack of Hearts, 9 of Diamonds
	 *
	 * - A method named shuffle() that shuffles the deck.
	 * --NOTE: You can make this as simple or complex as you choose. Swapping the first 2 cards within the deck
	 * is technically considered a shuffle. But so is swapping randomly selected cards 1000 times.
	 *
	 * - A drawCard() method that "draws" the next card from the top of the deck and returns the string of the card. Getter and
	 * setter methods should be used here.
	 * --NOTE: In this situation the TOP of the deck will start at array index 0.
	 * -- You should NOT be able to draw past the end of the deck.
	 *
	 * - A printDeck() method that prints out every card, one per line.
	 * -- Example:
	 *    King of Spades
	 *    Ace of Diamonds
   *    2 of Diamonds
   *    3 of Diamonds
   *
   * -- In the DeckTest class, create your own unit tests for the shuffle() method.
