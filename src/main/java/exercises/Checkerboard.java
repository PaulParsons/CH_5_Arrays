	/*
	 * Create a class that builds an 8 x 8 checkerboard and fills it with
	 * a set of checkers game pieces in their starting positions.
	 *
	 * A 2-dimensional array should be used for the board.
	 *
	 * The class should also have the ability to print your board in a readable
	 * fashion. My output looks like this:
	 *
	 *  B			[]		B			[]		B			[]		B			[]
			[]		B			[]		B			[]		B			[]		B
			B			[]		B			[]		B			[]		B			[]
			[]		[]		[]		[]		[]		[]		[]		[]
			[]		[]		[]		[]		[]		[]		[]		[]
			[]		R			[]		R			[]		R			[]		R
			R			[]		R			[]		R			[]		R			[]
			[]		R			[]		R			[]		R			[]		R

			Feel free to mimic that exactly if you like the look of it.

			Create a class in the test directory and write at least 2 unit tests for your class.
